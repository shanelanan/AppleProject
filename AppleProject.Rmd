## Extract, Transform, and Load

The first step is to fetch all sources of data via python web calls and parsing the provided .json file.  
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
system("python etl.py")

con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "apple.db")
df = dbGetQuery(con, "select * from sample") %>%
  mutate(INSERTED_ON = as.POSIXct(INSERTED_ON),
         MFG_DATE = as.POSIXct(MFG_DATE))
dbDisconnect(con)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
